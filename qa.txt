To definitely be able to login using https protocol, you should first set your authentication credential to the git Remote URI:
git remote set-url origin https://yourusername@github.com/user/repo.git
Then you'll be asked for a password when trying to git push.

In fact, this is on the http authentication format. You could set a password too:

https://youruser:password@github.com/user/repo.git
You should be aware that if you do this, your github password will be stored in plaintext in your .git directory, which is obviously undesirable.
